    description: 'Browse MTU 2000 series parts by category: pistons, liners, bearings, valves, gaskets, fuel system, cooling, turbocharging, sensors, and filters. Each part is verified by part number and engine serial number before quotation.',
    longDescription: `The MTU 2000 series is one of the most widely deployed diesel engine families in the world, powering everything from fast ferries and naval vessels to generator sets and locomotives. Available in 8V, 12V, 16V, and 18V configurations across multiple power ratings (M84, M91, M93, M94, M96), these engines share a common parts architecture that makes maintenance programs predictable — but also demanding when parts are needed urgently.

    Our MTU 2000 parts catalog is organized by functional category so procurement teams can move from "I need a fuel system part" to a verified quotation quickly. Every part number listed here has been cross-referenced against MTU's own electronic parts catalog, and we verify fitment against your engine serial number before quoting. This means you receive a quote for the part that actually fits your engine — not a generic catalog entry that may have been superseded.

    Common parts requests for the 2000 series include cylinder head gaskets (5410160920), fuel injectors (X53507500012), seawater pump impellers (X00022524), and oil filter spin-on elements (0031845201). These are high-frequency consumables that we typically hold in stock or can source within days. For major overhauls, we also supply pistons, liners, bearings, valves, and complete gasket kits.

    If you are maintaining a fleet of MTU 2000 engines — whether in a shipyard, a power plant, or a rail depot — send us your parts list and engine serial numbers. We check availability line by line and quote practical shipping from Shanghai to your destination.`,

    longDescription: `The MTU 4000 series represents the top tier of MTU's high-speed diesel engine range, with power outputs from 1,500 kW to over 4,300 kW in 12V, 16V, and 20V configurations. These engines are found in the world's most demanding applications: fast naval vessels, superyachts, offshore supply vessels, mission-critical data center generators, and heavy-haul locomotives.

    Parts for the 4000 series are engineered to extreme tolerances. Cylinder liners, pistons, and bearings are size-graded components where an incorrect grade selection — even by one step — can cause premature failure. Every part number in this catalog is verified against MTU's electronic parts catalog for your specific engine serial number before quotation. We supply both OEM and OEM-alternative options, with remanufactured components available for high-value assemblies like injectors and turbochargers.

    High-demand 4000 series parts include cylinder liners (5240113410), cylinder head gaskets (5240161580), injectors (EX52407500064), main bearings (5240334901), conrod bearings (5240383710), and turbocharger turbine wheels (5110804420). These are components where lead time can directly impact vessel availability or generator uptime. We stock common grades and can expedite special orders.

    For major overhauls, we recommend sending a complete parts list with engine serial numbers. We verify each line item, flag any superseded part numbers, and quote shipping from Shanghai via express courier, air freight, or sea freight depending on urgency and part dimensions.`,

Available in 8V, 12V, and 16V configurations (TE54, TE74L, TE84, TE94, TB34, TC52/82/92 variants), these engines remain in active service worldwide — and their parts demand has not diminished.

    Because the 396 series is now a legacy platform, genuine OEM parts availability can be inconsistent. This is where our verification process adds value: we check each part number against your engine serial number, confirm whether superseded references apply, and quote both OEM and OEM-alternative options with transparent lead times. Common 396 series requests include cylinder liners (5320110110), cylinder head covers (5320100130), exhaust valves (5410500227), inlet valves (4570530001), valve springs (5320530020), main and thrust bearings, oil pumps (5321800001), oil separators (5410100163), and turbocharger turbine wheels (5110800220/5110804420).

    For major overhauls, we recommend sending a complete parts list organized by engine serial number. Legacy engines often have running changes that affect part number compatibility — our verification step catches these before shipment.`,

    longDescription: `The MTU 595 series is a heavy-duty, high-output diesel engine platform designed for the most demanding marine and industrial applications. With bore sizes exceeding 200mm and power outputs per cylinder that place it firmly in the medium-speed engine category, the 595 series is found in naval combatants, large offshore supply vessels, and base-load power stations where reliability is non-negotiable.

    Parts for the 595 series reflect its heavy engineering heritage: cylinder liners weighing over 50 kg, pistons with separate crowns and skirts (5840371625 crown, 5840300615 skirt), connecting rods built for extreme cylinder pressures, and fuel systems operating at high injection pressures with HP fuel lines (5840700632-87) and solenoid valves (5840900595, 5840980257). Every component is size-graded and serial-number-specific.

    Because 595 series engines often serve in military or continuous-duty applications, parts traceability and documentation requirements can be stringent. We support part-number verification with engine serial numbers, provide HS codes and approximate weights for freight planning, and can quote with material certificates where required.`,

    For 956 series engines still in active duty, parts availability can vary by region and engine variant. We verify each part number against your engine serial number, check for supersessions, and quote both OEM and OEM-alternative options.

    longDescription: `Filters are the single most frequently replaced component on any MTU diesel engine. Whether it is a spin-on oil filter changed every 500 hours, a fuel filter protecting common-rail injectors from contamination, or an air filter keeping dust out of turbocharger compressor wheels — the right filter, available when you need it, is what keeps engines running and maintenance schedules on track.

    Our filter catalog covers the four critical filtration points on MTU engines: oil, fuel, air, and coolant. We stock common references for Series 2000, 4000, 396, 956, and 1163 engines. For fleet operators and service companies maintaining multiple engines, we offer bulk quantities with consolidated shipping to reduce per-unit cost. Each filter is verified by part number against your engine model before quotation.

    Common requests include oil filter spin-on elements (0031845201, 0031845301), fuel filter spin-on cartridges (0020922801, X57508300091), air filter elements (0030944304, 0170942502), and filter cartridges for legacy engines (0020940204). Many of these cross-reference across multiple MTU series, but we always verify fitment by engine serial number before shipment.

    If you are setting up a preventive maintenance program or need regular filter replenishment for a fleet, send us your filter part numbers and annual consumption estimates. We can quote scheduled deliveries that align with your maintenance intervals.`,

    summary: 'MTU fuel system parts — injectors, nozzle holders, fuel pumps, pressure valves, and fuel lines.',
    description: 'Fuel system parts directly affect combustion quality and fuel economy. We supply injectors, high and low-pressure pumps, nozzle holders, relief valves, and fuel lines for MTU 2000, 4000, 396, 595, and 956 series engines. New and remanufactured options available.',
    longDescription: `MTU common-rail and unit-pump fuel systems operate at extreme pressures — up to 2,200 bar on 4000 series engines. Injector performance directly determines combustion efficiency, exhaust emissions compliance, and fuel consumption. A single underperforming injector can cause cylinder imbalance, increased exhaust temperatures, and accelerated wear on piston rings and liners.

    Our fuel system parts catalog covers the complete injection chain: injectors and nozzle holders, high-pressure pumps (HPFP), low-pressure feed pumps, pressure relief and limiting valves, fuel lines, and associated sealing elements. We supply new OEM, OEM-alternative, and professionally remanufactured injectors. Reman options follow standardized procedures including ultrasonic cleaning, new nozzle tips, and bench testing to verify spray pattern and opening pressure.

    High-demand injectors include EX52407500064 for MTU 4000 series, X53507500012 for MTU 2000 series, and the L'Orange/Bosch variants used across multiple engine families. For injectors, always send the complete part number stamped on the injector body — not just the engine serial number — because multiple injector variants can exist within the same engine series depending on power rating and emissions certification.

    Fuel pumps and pressure valves are also listed here. The X53508200001 low-pressure pump and E0060704101 high-pressure pump are common requests for 2000 series marine and generator applications. Pressure relief valves (5501801015, 5361800515) are critical for maintaining correct rail pressure and should always be verified by engine serial number before ordering.`,

    longDescription: `MTU turbochargers are precision-rotating assemblies operating at speeds exceeding 100,000 RPM with exhaust gas inlet temperatures beyond 700 degrees Celsius. The turbine wheel, compressor wheel, bearing housing, and sealing rings form a balanced system where any component wear — even at the micron level — produces vibration, oil leakage, or efficiency loss that cascades into engine performance degradation.

    Our turbocharger parts catalog covers the complete rotating assembly: turbine wheels (5110804420, 5110800220, 5110800420), compressor wheels (5090251301), bearing housings (5110803201), piston ring seals (5110850060, 5120850560), heat shields (5110812603, 5110820226), and diffusers (5361420025). We verify each part number against your turbocharger nameplate — not just the engine serial — because turbocharger variants within the same engine series can differ by application, power rating, and emissions certification.

    Common failure modes include foreign-object damage to turbine blades from intake debris or exhaust manifold fragments, bearing housing bore wear causing radial play and oil leakage into the exhaust stream, and heat shield cracking from thermal cycling on engines with frequent start-stop duty cycles. We quote new OEM, OEM-alternative, and remanufactured options with transparent lead times.`,

    longDescription: `MTU engine sensors and electrical components form the nervous system of every engine installation — from crankcase speed pickups and rail pressure transducers to coolant temperature thermocouples and ECU memory modules. A failed sensor does not just produce a warning light; it can trigger a derate, an automatic shutdown, or in the worst case, allow a damaging condition to go undetected until catastrophic failure occurs.

    Our sensor and electrical parts catalog covers speed sensors (0005358233, 0005357933, 0005357633), pressure sensors (0035352531, 0035352731, 5205304531), temperature sensors (0005356430), level monitors (0005355103), solenoid valves (8495340000, 5840900595), and wiring harnesses (X00012160, X00011800). Each sensor type has specific connector, thread, and signal-range variants that must match the engine ECU configuration — we verify by part number and engine serial number before quotation.

    Common replacement triggers include intermittent signal faults during thermal cycling, connector corrosion in marine engine-room environments, and ECU-detected rationality errors during routine diagnostic checks. For fleet operators, we can quote sensor kits covering all critical monitoring points on a specific engine model.`,

    longDescription: `Gaskets, seals, and O-rings may be the smallest parts on an MTU engine by weight, but they are among the most consequential. A failed cylinder head gasket can pressurize the cooling system and cause overheating within minutes. A leaking turbocharger oil seal can empty the oil sump into the exhaust. A deteriorated O-ring on a fuel injector sleeve can allow combustion gas into the fuel return circuit. Every gasket and seal in this catalog has been selected because it serves a critical containment function.

    Our gasket and seal catalog covers cylinder head gaskets (5240161580, 5410160920, 5550161420), O-rings (700429260000, 700429050003), rotary and radial-lip shaft seals (8699970499, XP51529700004), copper sealing rings (007603016105), and valve stem seals (0000530361). We stock common references and can source application-specific material grades. For overhaul projects, we recommend complete gasket kits — they are more economical than ordering individual pieces and ensure every sealing surface is renewed.`,
