      'What renewable HVO diesel approval and IMO Tier III emission limits mean for MTU marine engine operators when they plan filters, fuel-system parts, and aftertreatment-related spares.',
    body: `
      <h2>Two Separate Changes</h2>
      <p>Operators often hear about HVO and IMO Tier III together, but they affect engines in different ways. <strong>HVO</strong> (hydrotreated vegetable oil) is a renewable paraffinic diesel covered by the EN 15940 fuel standard. It is a fuel change. <strong>IMO Tier III</strong> sets lower NOx limits for ships operating in emission control areas. On high-speed engines it is usually met with exhaust aftertreatment such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR), so it is a hardware change.</p>
      <h2>What HVO Means for Parts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use HVO only on engines and ratings the engine maker has released for EN 15940 fuels</li>
        <li>Switching fuel can loosen deposits in tanks and lines, so plan extra fuel-filter changes after the changeover</li>
        <li>Check seal and hose materials in older fuel systems when changing fuel type</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What Tier III Means for Parts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>SCR systems add dosing units, sensors, and reductant lines to the spare-parts list</li>
        <li>Exhaust-side sensors and control items become part of routine maintenance stock</li>
        <li>Parts references for Tier III installations should be checked against the vessel's exact configuration</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For filter references, see the <a href="/part-products/catalog/mtu-filters/">MTU filters catalog</a>; for marine engine parts in general, see <a href="/applications/marine-propulsion-engines/">MTU marine engine parts</a>.</p>

    body: `
      <h2>Frigate Power Systems Run for Decades</h2>
      <p>A frigate is usually planned for a service life of thirty years or more, and its propulsion and on-board power engines will go through several major overhauls in that time. Over that period part numbers are superseded, suppliers change, and the original documentation ages. Navies that plan spare parts from the start avoid many of the availability problems that older fleets face.</p>
      <h2>What Good Spares Planning Covers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>An initial spares package sized to the number of engines and the planned operating profile</li>
        <li>NATO stock numbers linked to each manufacturer part number for logistics systems</li>
        <li>A supersession record, so later numbers are recognised when old ones disappear</li>
        <li>Special tools for onboard and shore-based maintenance</li>

    body: `
      <h2>What "In Stock" Means on Our Quotes</h2>
      <p>Every quotation line carries an availability note. <strong>Ready stock</strong> means the part is on the shelf in Shanghai and can be packed once the order is confirmed. <strong>Partner stock</strong> means the item is held by a supply partner we buy from regularly and has to reach our warehouse first. <strong>Sourced to order</strong> means we have to locate the part, so the quote gives an estimated lead time instead of a dispatch date. We only label a line as ready stock after checking it at the time of quotation, and the quote states the expected dispatch time for each line.</p>
      <h2>Items That Usually Move Fastest</h2>
      <p>Maintenance parts for the MTU 2000, 4000, and 396 series make up most daily orders, so they are the items most often available from ready stock:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spin-on oil and fuel filters, such as the <a href="/part-products/0031845201-oil-filter-spin-on/">0031845201 oil filter</a> and <a href="/part-products/x57508300091-fuel-filter-spin-on/">X57508300091 fuel filter</a></li>
        <li>O-rings, sealing rings, and gaskets used in routine service</li>
        <li>Pressure, temperature, and speed sensors that cause alarms or shutdowns</li>
        <li>Injectors and fuel-system items for common ratings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Overhaul parts in size grades, cylinder heads, crankshaft components, and parts for legacy engines such as the 538 and 956 series are more often sourced to order.</p>
      <h2>Getting an Accurate Availability Answer</h2>
      <p>Stock answers are only as good as the part reference. Send the exact part number, quantity, and engine serial number, and tell us if a later or earlier number is acceptable. An Excel list is fastest for more than ten lines. You can also check individual numbers in the <a href="/part-products/">MTU parts catalog</a> before sending the inquiry.</p>

    body: `
      <h2>Support Included With Every Order</h2>
      <p>Buying engine parts across borders involves more than a price per line. These are the support steps behind a typical inquiry and order.</p>
      <h3>Part Identification</h3>
      <p>When a part number is missing, worn off, or superseded, we work from the engine data plate, photos of the old part, its installation position, and any casting or label marks. We confirm the reference with you before quoting, so the order is based on an agreed number rather than a guess.</p>
      <h3>Parts-List Cleanup</h3>
      <p>Maintenance lists often combine numbers from different manuals and years. We return your list with duplicates merged, superseded numbers flagged, and lines that need inspection first, such as graded liners and bearings, clearly marked.</p>
      <h3>Pre-Shipment Photos</h3>
      <p>On request, we photograph the parts, labels, and packaging before dispatch, so your team can compare them with the old parts before the shipment leaves Shanghai.</p>
      <h3>Export Documents and Packing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Commercial invoice and packing list matched to your purchase-order lines</li>
        <li>HS codes per line and certificate of origin where required</li>
        <li>Case marking with your PO number, vessel or project name, and consignee</li>
        <li>Wooden cases for heavy or fragile items; moisture protection for sea freight</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What We Do Not Do</h2>
      <p>We are a parts supplier, not a field service company. We do not send technicians to carry out repairs, but we can quote the parts and special tools your own technicians or local service partner need. See <a href="/part/mtu-specialized-tools/">MTU specialized tools</a>.</p>

    body: `
      <h2>Why Buyers Check on Arrival</h2>
      <p>Counterfeit and relabelled engine parts are a real risk in the spare-parts market, especially for filters, injectors, and sensors. A few minutes of checking when the parts arrive is far cheaper than an engine problem later. These are the checks we recommend, and the same ones we apply before parts leave our warehouse.</p>
      <h2>Buyer Checklist</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Part number marking.</strong> The number on the part or its label should match the quotation exactly, including any suffix after a slash.</li>
        <li><strong>Label and packaging.</strong> Look for clean, consistent printing and a label that is part of the original packaging rather than stuck over another one.</li>
        <li><strong>Comparison with the old part.</strong> Check dimensions, connector type, thread, and mounting points against the part you removed.</li>
        <li><strong>Supersession.</strong> If the number differs from your old part, the quote should state that it is a later or replacement reference.</li>
        <li><strong>Documents.</strong> The commercial invoice should list the same part numbers and quantities as the packing list and the boxes.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>How We Label Supply Routes</h2>
      <p>Not every buyer needs, or can wait for, an original MTU part. Our quotes state the route for each line, whether original, OEM-alternative, or remanufactured exchange, so you know exactly what you are paying for. The routes are explained on our <a href="/capabilities/genuine-oem-parts/">verified OEM sourcing</a> page.</p>
      <p>If anything on arrival does not match, do not install the part. Send photos of the part, label, and packaging as soon as possible so we can review it with you.</p>

      'Choosing engine oil for MTU diesel engines: MTU oil categories, why the fluids specification matters for warranty and service intervals, and how we supply approved oils with parts orders.',
    body: `
      <h2>Oil Approval Matters on MTU Engines</h2>
      <p>MTU does not approve engine oils by viscosity grade alone. Oils are listed in the MTU Fluids and Lubricants Specifications (publication A001061) under oil categories, commonly referred to as Category 1, 2, 2.1, 3, and 3.1. The category allowed for an engine depends on the series, the fuel quality, and the oil-change interval you want to run. Higher categories generally allow longer intervals where the engine and fuel permit it.</p>
      <h2>How to Choose</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Check the engine's operating instructions for the permitted oil categories</li>
        <li>Consider fuel sulfur content; high-sulfur fuel can limit the choice of oil and interval</li>
        <li>Use only oils listed in the current fluids specification for that category</li>
        <li>Avoid mixing different oils between changes, and record the oil used in the maintenance log</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Supplying Oil With a Parts Order</h2>
      <p>We quote MTU-approved oils mainly for buyers who want to consolidate oil with a filter and parts shipment, for example a vessel or remote generator site. Oil is heavy, so it is usually economical only by sea or consolidated freight, and drums or pails need proper palletizing. Tell us the engine series, required category, viscosity, and quantity in liters, and we will quote it together with the matching <a href="/part-products/catalog/mtu-filters/">MTU filters</a>.</p>

    body: `
      <h2>Coolant Is a Specified Fluid, Not a Commodity</h2>
      <p>MTU engines use coolant made from treated water mixed with either an approved antifreeze concentrate or an approved corrosion inhibitor where freezing is not a risk. Approved products are listed in the MTU Fluids and Lubricants Specifications (publication A001061). Using an unapproved product, or the wrong concentration, can lead to cavitation on cylinder liners, corrosion in heat exchangers, and deposits that reduce cooling performance.</p>
      <h2>Common Coolant Mistakes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Mixing different coolant chemistries when topping up</li>
        <li>Using untreated hard water instead of water that meets the specified quality</li>
        <li>Running too little concentrate, which reduces corrosion protection</li>
        <li>Skipping regular coolant checks on standby generators that run few hours</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Coolant and Cooling-System Parts Together</h2>
      <p>Coolant problems usually show up as failed water-pump seals, thermostats, or heat-exchanger leaks. If you are replacing cooling-system parts, it is a good time to flush and refill with an approved product. We can quote coolant together with parts from the <a href="/part-products/catalog/mtu-cooling-system/">MTU cooling system catalog</a>, including pumps, impellers, thermostats, and seals.</p>
      <p>Send the engine series, the product you currently use, the system volume, and the destination. Like oil, coolant is best shipped by sea or consolidated with a larger order. For engine oil, see <a href="/mtu-oils/">MTU oils</a>.</p>

      <h2>MTU Engines in Rail Service</h2>
      <p>MTU engines power diesel locomotives, diesel multiple units, power cars, and track-maintenance machines in many countries. Rail engines carry an "R" in the model code, for example 12V 4000 R43 or 16V 4000 R84, and are often supplied as part of a complete power pack built to the vehicle maker's layout. That combination of engine rating, emission stage, and installation decides which parts fit.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Filters and service items for mileage- or hour-based exams</li>
        <li>Injectors, high-pressure pumps, and fuel-system seals</li>

        <li>Cylinder heads, pistons, liners, bearings, and gasket kits for depot overhauls</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Series 4000 Rail Generations</h2>
      <p>The Series 4000 rail engine has been built in several generations. Parts are not always interchangeable between them, so we keep separate notes for the <a href="/series-4000-r03/">Series 4000 R03</a> and <a href="/series-4000-r04/">Series 4000 R04</a> build families.</p>
      <h2>Information to Send</h2>
      <p>For each engine, send the model code and serial number from the data plate, the vehicle builder and class, and the part numbers from the current parts documentation. If you are ordering for several vehicles, a fleet list with one line per engine lets us spot where engines in the same fleet have different build standards, which is common after earlier overhauls or modifications.</p>

      <p>MTU identifies engine generations with the last digit of the application code. Rail engines of the third build generation, such as the 12V 4000 R43 and 16V 4000 R43, are widely used in freight and passenger locomotives and have been in service for many years. Many fleets are now in their second or third major overhaul cycle on these engines, which makes overhaul parts and supersessions a frequent topic.</p>

        <li>Turbocharger parts and charge-air components</li>
        <li>Pistons, liners, bearings, and cylinder-head parts for overhaul</li>
        <li>Sensors and wiring items that trigger derates</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Supersession Checks</h2>
      <p>Over a long production run, many part numbers have been updated. When you send numbers from an older parts list, we check each one against its current reference and tell you if the later part is a direct replacement or needs related parts to be changed at the same time.</p>
      <h2>Overhaul Planning</h2>
      <p>A major overhaul on an R03-generation engine normally replaces gasket sets, seals, piston rings, and bearings as standard, while liners, pistons, valves, and turbocharger parts depend on inspection results. We quote the standard items as firm lines and the inspection-dependent items as provisional lines, so the depot can order the first group immediately.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>More sensors and electronic components per engine, each with its own reference</li>
        <li>Fuel-system parts matched to the emission configuration, not only to the cylinder count</li>

      </ul>
      <p>The 183 parts pages list the catalog reference, dimensions, and weight where known. Fitment still depends on the full engine model and serial number, because marine and generator versions use different cooling arrangements.</p>
      <h2>When the Part Number Is Unknown</h2>

      <p>The MTU 538 series is a large high-speed diesel used mainly in fast naval craft and patrol vessels. Many of these vessels remain in service long after the engine left production, so operators depend on suppliers who can trace old part references and locate parts that are no longer common.</p>
      <h2>Parts in Our 538 Series Catalog</h2>

        <li>Slotted nuts, tab washers, and other fastening parts</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Old Reference Formats</h2>
      <p>Some 538 parts use older reference formats that include letters and a slash suffix, such as 135L45018/1. Keep the suffix when you send the number, since it identifies a specific version. If only a drawing position or an old parts-list page is available, send a photo of it together with the engine serial number.</p>
      <p>Naval buyers can ask for NATO stock numbers and HS codes on the quotation where they are known.</p>
      <h2>Overhaul Lists for 538 Engines</h2>

      <p>The MTU Series 1800 is a six-cylinder engine range used mainly in rail vehicles and industrial equipment. Unlike our larger MTU 2000, 4000, and 396 catalogs, the 1800 section of our online catalog is small, for example the <a href="/part-products/x50441600048-air-hose/">X50441600048 air hose</a>. Most 1800 parts are quoted on request after we check the engine data.</p>
      <h2>What Buyers Usually Need</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Oil, fuel, and air filters for scheduled service</li>
        <li>Belts, hoses, thermostats, and water-pump parts</li>
        <li>Sensors and electrical items</li>
        <li>Gasket sets and seals for top-end repairs</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How to Get a Fast Answer</h2>
      <p>Because Series 1800 engines are installed by many vehicle and equipment builders, the engine data plate is essential. Send the full model code and serial number, the part numbers from your parts book, and the equipment make. For filters and belts, a photo of the existing part with its label often shortens the check.</p>
      <h2>Rail Power Packs</h2>
      <p>In rail vehicles, a Series 1800 engine is often part of a complete power pack that also contains the cooling system, exhaust, and transmission interface supplied by the pack builder. Parts on the engine itself follow MTU references, while radiators, hoses, and mounting items may follow the pack or vehicle builder's numbers. Tell us the vehicle type and pack designation where known, and we will split the list accordingly.</p>
      <p>If you operate mixed fleets, you can combine Series 1800 lines with <a href="/part-products/catalog/mtu-2000-series/">MTU 2000</a> or <a href="/part-products/catalog/mtu-4000-series/">MTU 4000</a> parts on one inquiry.</p>

      'MTU special tools for engine maintenance and overhaul: barring devices, pullers, fitting and removal devices, gauges, and tool kits, sourced by tool number.',

      <h2>Why Special Tools Matter</h2>
      <p>Many MTU maintenance tasks, such as turning the crankshaft, removing liners, or setting injector protrusion, require tools designed for the specific engine. Using improvised tools risks damaging expensive components or getting incorrect settings. MTU special tool numbers usually start with "F", for example F6792918.</p>
      <h2>Tools in Our Catalog</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Barring devices and tools for turning the engine, such as the <a href="/part-products/f6792918-barring-tool/">F6792918 barring tool</a></li>
        <li>Pullers and fitting/removal devices, such as <a href="/part-products/f6780562-puller/">F6780562</a></li>
        <li>Measuring tools, such as the <a href="/part-products/y20098771-feeler-gauge/">Y20098771 feeler gauge</a></li>
        <li>Oil-filter wrenches and service tool kits, such as <a href="/part-products/f30453006-tool-kit/">F30453006</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Ordering Tools With an Overhaul</h2>
      <p>The best time to check tools is when planning a major job. Look at the tool list in the maintenance task for your engine, compare it with the tools in your workshop, and add the missing numbers to the parts inquiry. Tools are often slower to source than consumable parts, so ordering them early avoids delays once the engine is opened.</p>
      <p>Send the tool number, the engine series it is used on, and the quantity. If the number is unknown, describe the task and send a photo of the tool page in your manual.</p>
      <h2>Shipping Tools</h2>
      <p>Some special tools are heavy or have precision measuring surfaces. We pack them in fitted cases or wooden crates with moisture protection, and state the gross weight and dimensions on the quotation so you can compare express and freight costs before ordering.</p>
