## Stack

- Astro 5 (static site generation)
- TypeScript client scripts
- `@astrojs/sitemap` for SEO
- Cloudflare Worker (`cloudflare-worker.js`) for RFQ form submissions via Zoho SMTP + R2

### Worker secrets

RFQ API is implemented in `cloudflare-worker.js` (deployed as the Worker entry
by `scripts/create-worker-entry.mjs`) and sends inquiries through Zoho SMTP.
The legacy `functions/` directory is not used by the production Worker deployment.

Set these secrets/bindings on Cloudflare Pages:

- `ZOHO_SMTP_PASS` — Zoho app password for `sales@dieselpartsource.com`
- `R2_BUCKET` — R2 bucket binding for drawing uploads
- `RFQ_DOWNLOAD_SECRET` — HMAC secret used for private drawing links that expire after 7 days

Email is sent via Zoho SMTP (`smtppro.zoho.com:465`), with the mailbox and host
declared in `wrangler.toml`.
